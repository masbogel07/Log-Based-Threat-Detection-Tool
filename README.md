## Log-Based Threat Detection System

An automated cybersecurity tool designed to analyze system and application logs to detect malicious activities, improve threat visibility, and support effective incident response.

## Project Overview

The Log-Based Threat Detection System focuses on identifying security threats by analyzing log data generated by systems and applications.
It integrates detection rules, threat intelligence, dashboards, and reporting features to assist in proactive security monitoring.

This project was developed as part of an internship project to demonstrate practical implementation of industry-aligned cybersecurity concepts.

## Objectives

Analyze system and application logs to identify suspicious activities

Detect malicious patterns using rule-based detection techniques

Automate alerting, reporting, and response mechanisms

Provide clear visualization through dashboards and reports

## System Modules

GUI Interface Module – User-friendly interface for log loading and analysis

Log Parsing Module – Extracts relevant fields from raw log files

Normalization & Decoding Module – Decodes URL-encoded and HTML-escaped inputs

Threat Detection Module – Identifies threats using predefined detection rules

Threat Intelligence (IOC) Module – Detects known malicious IPs and auto-blocks them

Reporting & Dashboard Module – Generates PDF reports and visual analytics

## Project Enhancements

Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use

Interactive security dashboard for threat visualization

Threat intelligence (IOC) integration with auto-blocking

Input normalization and decoding before detection

Automated PDF report generation for identified attacks

## Technologies Used

Python – Core development

Tkinter & ttkbootstrap – GUI implementation

Regular Expressions (Regex) – Threat detection logic

Matplotlib – Dashboard visualization

ReportLab – PDF report generation

SMTP – Email alert notifications

## Administrative Privileges

Certain security-related operations are designed to support administrator-level execution for secure system-level functionality.
Core log analysis features can operate in standard user mode.

## Output

Detected threats with severity classification

Automated PDF and CSV reports

Dashboard-based visualization of security events

Email alerts for critical and high-severity threats


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical approach to log-based threat detection by combining automation, visualization, and reporting.
It follows industry-level security practices and showcases real-world application of cybersecurity concepts.
